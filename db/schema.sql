-- =============================================================================
-- ORDER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM — PostgreSQL schema (Supabase)
-- Nyko Mart / Rugara / CASA ARRA
--
-- Rewritten from the Google Sheets / Apps Script system defined in
-- build.py (32 sheet layouts) and gscript/Code.gs (business logic). This is
-- a NORMALIZED relational design, not a 1:1 sheet-to-table dump — see the
-- mapping table below and webapp/db/SCHEMA_NOTES.md for the full reasoning,
-- open questions and sheet-by-sheet notes.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- KEY DESIGN DECISIONS
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- 1. PRIMARY KEYS: UUID (gen_random_uuid()) on every transactional/entity
--    table. Reasoning: this becomes a Supabase-backed app exposed over
--    PostgREST/Supabase client to a browser — UUIDs avoid leaking row counts
--    / sequential IDs to the client, work naturally with Supabase Auth (auth
--    user ids are UUIDs, see employees.auth_user_id), and need no central
--    sequence coordination if the app ever writes offline-first or from an
--    edge function. Exception: a handful of pure static lookup tables whose
--    natural key already IS a stable short code — `currencies` (ISO code)
--    and `capabilities` (short string code) — use that code as primary key
--    instead of adding a redundant surrogate UUID.
--
-- 2. company_id FOREIGN KEYS: every per-company table carries a `company_id
--    uuid REFERENCES companies(id)` column instead of a repeated text
--    column ("Nyko Mart" / "Rugara" / "CASA ARRA"). The old system's
--    "All_Orders_Master" + 3 near-identical per-company order tabs collapse
--    into ONE `orders` table with a `company_id` FK (see #3).
--
-- 3. ORDERS: the old system wrote every order TWICE — once to
--    All_Orders_Master and once to the matching company tab (Nyko Mart /
--    Rugara / CASA ARRA), kept in sync by matching ENTRY TIMESTAMP. That
--    duplication was a Google Sheets limitation (Apps Script has no live
--    cross-sheet FILTER), not a real business need. Here there is ONE
--    `orders` table with `company_id`; "give me Nyko Mart's orders" is just
--    `WHERE company_id = ...`, and "give me every order" needs no separate
--    table at all.
--
-- 4. FORMULA-DRIVEN SHEETS become, per case:
--      (a) a GENERATED ALWAYS AS ... STORED column, when the arithmetic
--          only references OTHER COLUMNS IN THE SAME ROW (e.g. Freight
--          Bill's TOTAL AMT = FREIGHT AMT + FUEL AMT + OTHER CHARGES).
--          NOTE: PostgreSQL generated columns cannot reference another
--          generated column, so multi-step same-row formulas are written
--          with the full expression inlined at each step (documented
--          per-column below).
--      (b) a SQL VIEW, when the arithmetic pulls from OTHER TABLES (e.g.
--          Freight Reconciliation's INDEX/MATCH-by-AWB lookups into
--          Dispatch & Invoice, or Net Revenue's cross-sheet SUM). Nothing
--          is stored twice; the view recomputes live, same as the sheet did.
--      (c) application code, when the rule is genuinely conditional /
--          stateful and not expressible as a pure per-row or per-query
--          formula (buyer-batch tagging, duplicate-order detection,
--          document-number *reservation timing*). These are documented as
--          comments on the relevant table, not implemented in SQL — see
--          "BUSINESS RULES ENFORCED IN APPLICATION CODE" below.
--
-- 5. DOCUMENT NUMBERING (e.g. "NM/CN/26-27/0006", "PO-0001-1/2"): the
--    running-sequence PART of this genuinely CAN be done cleanly in
--    PostgreSQL (see section 2, `sequence_counters` + `reserve_next_number()`
--    + BEFORE INSERT triggers on Debit Note / Credit Note / Washing Data /
--    Internal Invoice / HR Letters) using an atomic INSERT ... ON CONFLICT
--    DO UPDATE ... RETURNING, which is race-safe under concurrent inserts
--    without an explicit advisory lock. Order PO/RF/RG numbers use the SAME
--    counter table and function, but are NOT trigger-generated, because
--    *whether* to reserve a fresh number at all is conditional business
--    logic (duplicate-dispatched-order reuse, manual override) that must
--    run in the application before the row is written — see comments on
--    `orders.ref_no` below.
--
-- 6. ENUM TYPES are used for the sheet's FIXED dropdown lists that had no
--    "add a new value" admin function in Code.gs (Status, Shipment Status,
--    Address Type, Duty & Tax Mode, Delivered/NOT Delivered, Bank Status,
--    Payment Type, Invoice Type, Refund Type, Attendance Status/Source,
--    Letter Type). Lists that WERE runtime-extensible in the old system
--    (addCompany_, addItemCategory_, addSize_, addParty) became real master
--    tables instead (`companies`, `item_categories`, `sizes`, `parties`,
--    `skus`), each with the obvious CRUD replacing the old "append to a
--    hidden Lists column" trick.
--
-- 7. "SIZES" is a special case: the source SIZES_LIST has ~280 real-world
--    values with inconsistent case/typos ("5X5 ft" vs "5X5 FT") that were
--    never cleaned up, plus a "CUSTOME SIZE" catch-all. Orders keep BOTH a
--    nullable `size_id` FK (for new entries picked from the clean `sizes`
--    master list) and a raw `size_label` text column (always populated,
--    preserving whatever was actually typed/imported) — see
--    SCHEMA_NOTES.md open question #4.
--
-- =============================================================================
-- BUSINESS RULES ENFORCED IN APPLICATION CODE, NOT SQL
-- (documented here + repeated as a comment at point of use)
-- =============================================================================
-- • BUYER-BATCH SUFFIX ("-1/2, -2/2"): when the same buyer (matched by
--   contact_no digits-only, falling back to buyer_name_address trimmed/
--   lowercased, when contact_no is blank) places more than one order on the
--   same order_date within one company, every one of that buyer's orders
--   that day gets its ref_no suffixed "-position/total" (oldest first),
--   recomputed from scratch on every new/edited order in the batch. A lone
--   order that day keeps its bare ref_no. See orders.ref_no comment.
-- • DUPLICATE-DISPATCHED-ORDER REUSE: before reserving a new PO/RF/RG
--   number, the app checks whether this is really the SAME marketplace
--   order (same buyer-match-key + same marketplace order_no) as an existing
--   order in the SAME company that has ALREADY been dispatched. If so, the
--   new row reuses that existing order's base ref_no instead of getting a
--   fresh number or being pulled into a batch-suffix group.
-- • DOCUMENT-NUMBER RESERVATION TIMING (orders only): a PO/RF/RG number is
--   reserved (via reserve_next_number(), see below) ONLY at the moment an
--   order is actually saved — never when the entry form merely displays a
--   suggested next number — so a person who opens the form and abandons it
--   does not burn/skip a number. Debit Note / Credit Note / Washing Data /
--   Internal Invoice / HR Letters don't have this "preview vs reserve"
--   distinction in the UI, so those use a straightforward BEFORE INSERT
--   trigger instead (see section 2).
-- • CURRENCY CONVERSION: order_value_usd / order_value_inr / exchange_rate
--   are computed by the application at insert/update time (official rate
--   on file as of the order's own date, falling back to a live market
--   estimate, never a silent guess) and then stored — they are NOT SQL
--   GENERATED columns, because the source of truth (exchange_rates) lives
--   in another table and Postgres generated columns cannot reference other
--   tables. exchange_rate_source always records which path was used.

-- Old: Lists!F ("Item Categories"), extended at runtime by addItemCategory_().
-- 2026-08-06: hsn_code added — the CSB-V/CSB-IV invoice's item table needs a
-- per-category HSN code (see real sample invoices NL1702627.pdf/ERG122627.pdf/
-- ERG092627.pdf) printed against every line item. Nullable because we only
-- have confirmed codes for 3 of 9 real categories so far; invoice generation
-- must not silently print a blank/wrong HSN — validate it's set before
-- allowing an invoice to be created for that category.
-- 2026-08-11: harmonized_tariff_number added — "HSN code ke sath ek coloum
-- Harmonized Tariff Number" (a column alongside HSN code). HSN is the
-- universal 6-digit code; several destination countries extend it with
-- their own longer national tariff schedule (e.g. USA's 10-digit HTS —
-- see https://hts.usitc.gov/). Same nullable/manual-entry pattern as
-- hsn_code above (no per-country lookup — the business enters whichever

-- The recomputed/looked-up part of the old Freight Reconciliation sheet
-- (everything that was an INDEX/MATCH-by-AWB formula pulling from Dispatch
-- & Invoice) — a straight VIEW joining the manual assignment table above to
-- dispatch_invoices/orders. Column-for-column mapping verified against the
-- old sheet's own di_lookup() calls in build.py (e.g. its "M" GST 18% AMT.
-- lookup is Dispatch & Invoice's SECOND gst column — courier_shipping_
-- charge_without_gst's paired amount — not the first "GST 18%" used inside
-- TOTAL AMT; both are modeled as separate columns on dispatch_invoices).
-- Gap 1 (2026-08-20): awb_no/our_weight/dimensional_weight now pull from
-- the SPECIFIC order_shipments/order_packages row this assignment points
-- at (accurate per-AWB), not dispatch_invoices' order-level summary (which
-- can be a multi-value join once an order has >1 AWB) — di.* stays for the
-- order-level billing figures (charges, gst, invoice_no), which are out of
-- scope for the per-package rearchitecture this round.
--
-- 2026-08-20 (order-value fix): org_sale_amt_inr is now o.order_value_inr
-- (orders), not di.org_sale_amt_inr (dispatch_invoices). The latter is a
-- dead column — nothing in the app writes it, it only ever got a value
-- from the one-time historical import — so every order dispatched since
-- then showed a 0.00 Sale Amt / shipping_pct here. order_value_inr is
-- app-computed on every order insert/edit (see orders table comment
-- above) and is the one true "order value" everywhere revenue/% is
-- computed from; sales_invoices.invoice_value_usd/inr stays completely
-- separate — that's the invoice DOCUMENT's own figure, unrelated to this.

-- RECEIVED CHALAN — 2026-08-29 (evening, follow-up round). The
-- "party -> company" counterpart to Material OUT Chalan, but deliberately
-- NOT wired to stock_in — Purchase Bill and Stock In are two entirely
-- separate, unlinked systems in this app, so auto-generating a Received
-- Chalan from a Purchase Bill save must not silently create phantom
-- stock_in rows the user never entered (real double-counting risk for
-- anyone who also does a manual Stock In for the same delivery). This is a
-- paperwork/proof-of-receipt document, same design philosophy as
-- journal_vouchers — best-effort, non-blocking, snapshot-based, never a
-- ledger mutation. See db/2026-08-29-received-chalan-and-moc-fields.sql for

-- 2026-08-20 (order-value fix, part 2 — P&L goes live): user confirmed P&L
-- should also switch to orders.order_value_inr as its revenue driver
-- instead of only ever reading the CSV-imported sale_profit_ledger. Per
-- the user's own decisions this round: (1) expenses = order-tied Courier +
-- Duty (via freight_reconciliation_view/duty_reconciliation_view, summed
-- per order) PLUS every purchase_bills row company-wide, whether or not
-- it's linked to a specific order (g_total_plus_gst, GST-inclusive — same
-- convention as gross_shipping_amt/duty_gross_amt); (2) month grouping is
-- now orders.order_date (not an invoice date). Cancelled orders are
-- excluded from revenue and expense (a cancelled order isn't a real sale)
-- — Returned stays included, since a return is a fulfilled sale that came
-- back; refunds are handled by the separate `refunds` table, out of scope
-- here. This is an assumption, not a confirmed user decision — flag if
-- Cancelled/Returned handling should differ.
--
-- 2026-08-25 RESOLVED: user confirmed ("ha kar do isko bhi") — Returned
-- (and any other refunded, non-Cancelled) order's revenue here now nets
-- against its refund(s). See `order_refund_totals` in
-- pl_dashboard_by_company_view / pl_dashboard_by_month_view below, and the
-- same fix in src/app/dashboard/reports/sale-profit/page.tsx.
--
-- sale_profit_ledger is NOT dropped and NOT ignored: rows with order_id
-- IS NULL are genuinely historical entries that predate the live `orders`
-- table (per that table's own comment — the Statement Entry CSV-import
-- screen still exists for exactly this backfill case) and have no other
-- source, so they're still added in. Rows WITH an order_id are now
-- skipped here (the live order they point at is already counted via
-- `orders` directly) to avoid double-counting the same sale twice.

-- SECTION 14 — PORTAL PAYMENT RECONCILIATION
-- Old sheet header preserved the source export's own column names,
-- including its typos/odd punctuation, specifically so a portal's raw CSV
-- export could be re-uploaded with zero relabeling. That reasoning was a
-- Google-Sheets-CSV-import convenience, not a data-modeling one — this
-- table uses clean snake_case columns; the IMPORT LAYER (application code,
-- not this schema) is what should keep the "match the real export headers"
-- flexibility, e.g. a per-source column-mapping config.

-- 2026-08-13: NEW marketplace — "amazon" (user's own word, ground-up
-- build, ground truth was 2 real "Transactions" report exports: one for
-- amazon.co.uk (GBP), one for amazon.com (USD), same seller ARTS OF
-- JAIPUR / NYKO MART. Order-linked rows (Order Payment/Refund) carry
-- Amazon's own real order ID (format "XXX-XXXXXXX-XXXXXXX") in Order ID
-- — same "native column, no extraction needed" situation as eBay's Tax
-- Invoice Detail. Account-level rows (Service Fees for
-- Subscription/Cost of Advertising/etc., Unavailable balance, Paid to
-- Amazon | Seller repayment) correctly show "---" instead. A few Service
-- Fees rows carry a non-order reference in Order ID instead (a GUID for
-- "Voucher Participation Fee", an "FBA...” code for "FBA Inbound
-- Placement Service Fee") — verified these never collide with Amazon's
-- real dashed order-ID format, so no extra filtering is needed for order
-- matching to stay correct.
-- amazon_fees is signed the same way as Etsy/eBay's fee columns
-- (negative = charge, positive = credited back on a refund) — verified
-- against real Refund rows in both files.
-- currency is NOT parsed from the CSV (the "Total" column's own header
-- literally changes per marketplace — "Total (GBP)" vs "Total (USD)" —
-- so it can't be a single static column-header mapping); each currency's
-- CSV Upload template (see src/lib/statement-import/tables.ts) hardcodes
-- its own currency value + date format instead (see next paragraph). Only
-- GBP and USD are set up so far, since those are the only 2 real exports
-- supplied — a new marketplace/currency needs its own template entry
-- once a real export for it is supplied (not guessed ahead of time).
-- Date format is a REAL per-marketplace landmine: the UK export's Date
-- column is DD/MM/YYYY ("13/08/2026"), the US export's is M/D/YYYY
-- ("8/12/2026") — confirmed against each file's own stated date range in
-- its filename. Postgres' default DateStyle would misparse (or outright
-- reject) one of these if both were imported as plain "date" text, so the
-- importer converts each to ISO before insert based on which currency
-- template was used (see csv-upload/actions.ts's date_dmy/date_mdy
-- column types).

-- real months (Jan/Apr/Jul/Aug-generated) and reproduced the PDF's own
-- printed Closing funds EXACTLY (not just close) every time — a much
-- tighter reconciliation than Etsy's per-line-rounding case, since this
-- report shows only 2-decimal USD figures with no intermediate rounding
-- step. closing_funds_stated is still hand-typed from the PDF (not
-- dropped) so a real data-entry mistake shows up as a mismatch against
-- the generated column, same audit pattern as this file's other

-- and RLS is what actually restricts which rows reach a given employee).
-- No INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policy for the anon/browser role is defined —
-- every WRITE goes through group-actions.ts's Server Actions via the
-- service-role client instead (bypasses RLS; application-layer checks are
-- the real gate there — same established pattern as
-- direct_messages/actions.ts), so no code path ever writes these tables
-- through the anon role.

-- Total unread GROUP message count for one employee — used for the
-- Messenger popup's badge (layout.tsx) and reusable anywhere else that
-- needs it, so the "what counts as unread" definition lives in exactly
-- one place. A message counts as unread if it's newer than this member's
-- last_read_at for that conversation (or, if they've never read it, newer
-- than when they joined — so messages sent before someone was added never
-- retroactively count against them) and wasn't sent by themselves.

-- 2026-08-12 (round 7): merged in from db/2026-08-08-marketplace-connectors.sql
-- and db/2026-08-10-shipglobal.sql — both were applied directly to the live
-- Supabase project but had never been folded back into this file, so a
-- fresh local build from schema.sql alone (see README's "Local schema
-- checks") silently diverged from production: 5 tables + 1 capability
-- missing, which surfaced as a `src/types/database.ts` regeneration
-- breaking every file that already referenced these tables
-- (src/lib/courier-webhooks/apply-tracking-event.ts,
-- src/app/dashboard/shipglobal/*). Caught and fixed as part of the
-- "poore system ko dubara chaek kar lena" pass this round. No behavior
-- change — this is a pure merge, same tables/columns as those two files.
