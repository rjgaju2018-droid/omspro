-- Invoice value breakdown (item cost / insurance / freight) + fuller
-- customs-invoice detail fields — 2026-08-10.
--
-- User's ask (verified against a real sample invoice, NL1712627.pdf,
-- COST=41.58 / INSURANCE=0.75 / FREIGHT=96.27 / TOTAL=138.60 — every
-- number below was reverse-engineered against that exact sample and
-- matches to the cent):
--
--   Amazon orders  -> declared invoice value = 60% of the order's real
--                     value (orders.order_value_usd).
--   Etsy/Website/eBay orders -> declared invoice value = 60% too — this
--                     was originally spec'd as 80%, then corrected
--                     2026-08-10 ("Etsy/Website/eBay → 60% kar do") to
--                     match Amazon. See src/lib/invoices/value-
--                     breakdown.ts's valuePercentForStore() — the single
--                     source of truth for this percentage.
--
-- That declared value (called `invoice_value_usd` below, "V") is then
-- broken into 3 customs line items that always sum EXACTLY to V:
--   item_cost_total = 30% of V
--   insurance_total = a flat USD 0.75 (not a % — confirmed exact match
--                     against the sample regardless of V)
--   freight_total   = V - item_cost_total - insurance_total (the
--                     BALANCING remainder — the user described this as
--                     "69.25%", which is what that remainder typically
--                     works out to as a % of V for their usual order
--                     sizes, but it is NOT an independent 69.25%
--                     multiplier: computing it that way would leave the
--                     3 line items NOT summing to V, which a real customs
--                     invoice can't tolerate. Confirmed against the
--                     sample: 0.30*138.60=41.58 exact match; freight =
--                     138.60-41.58-0.75=96.27 exact match; 69.25% would
--                     have given 95.98, NOT the real sample's 96.27).

-- CSB-IV ("csv-4 me manual rakho value kitni rakhnai hai" — keep CSB-IV's
-- value manual): these 3 new totals + value_percent stay NULL/blank by
-- default for a CSB-IV invoice — no auto-calculation happens, the
-- generate form leaves them as plain editable number inputs the preparer
-- fills in by hand, same structural columns, no automatic marketplace-%
-- logic. Only CSB-V gets the automatic 60% + 30%/flat-0.75/remainder
-- computation at generation time (src/app/dashboard/invoices/actions.ts).
--
-- Applies identically across all 3 companies (Nyko Mart / Rugara / CASA
-- ARRA) — "sabhi company me yahi fanda rahega" — the logic lives in one
-- shared function, not duplicated per company.
