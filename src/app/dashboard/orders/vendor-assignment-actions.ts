// Vendor Assignment history (2026-09-08) — "order fill hone ke baad, ek
// alag section — kis party ko order diya aur kis date ko; jab order wapas
// aaye to received mark karne ka option; agar party se galat order ho jaye
// to usko dobara assign bhi kar sake". This is a NEW, separate section from
// the existing "Purchasing From (if known)" `vendor_party_id` select on the
// order-creation/edit forms (order-form.tsx / order-edit-form.tsx) — that
// select stays exactly as-is, an optional convenience at entry time. This
// file is the full multi-cycle assign -> receive -> (if wrong) reassign
// history, backed by order_vendor_assignments — see
// db/2026-09-08-order-address-fields-and-vendor-assignments.sql for the
// schema and the full rationale.
//
// orders.vendor_party_id / vendor_date / received_date are kept mirrored to
// the LATEST cycle by the two mutations below (createVendorAssignment,
// markVendorAssignmentReceived) — both as sequential awaited writes in the
// same server action, no client-side race — so every existing report/
// purchase-bill form/order-list filter that already reads
// orders.vendor_party_id (~20 files, confirmed by grep before writing this)
// keeps seeing "the order's current vendor" correctly, and vendor_date/
// received_date (previously dead columns — zero usages anywhere) finally
// get populated instead of sitting unused.
//
// Gated behind the existing "order_entry" capability — same one
// updateOrder/deleteOrder/holdOrder/etc. in ./actions.ts already require for
// editing an order. No new capability needed: assigning/receiving a vendor
// cycle is just another facet of managing an order, and every role that can
// already edit an order can already reach this action's data.
