// gets wrapped as a callable server reference, and a plain object export
// fails hard at runtime ("A 'use server' file can only export async
// functions, found object"), which took down every dashboard page tonight
// (2026-08-22) since CompanySwitcher is rendered in the layout shell. Fixed
// by moving the constant into company-switcher.tsx itself, the only
// consumer — see it there instead.

/**
 * Sets "which company is this login currently acting as" — see the cookie's
 * doc comment in require-capability.ts. Re-validates the target company
 * against the employee's real access list server-side (never trusts the
 * submitted value alone, same reasoning as requireCapability()).
 *
 * Bug fix (2026-08-22, per owner's repeated "switcher still has problems"
 * reports): this used to `return` with no value at all when the requested
 * company wasn't actually in the employee's companyIds — completely silent
 * from the client's point of view, so the dropdown just visually reverted
 * with zero explanation. It now always returns an explicit {success,
 * error} state (useActionState on the client side) so company-switcher.tsx
 * can show the same "you don't have access" wording already used
 * everywhere else in this app (see e.g. src/app/dashboard/salary/actions.ts,
 * src/app/dashboard/attendance/admin/actions.ts) instead of failing quietly.

 * deleted anywhere, it just stops counting. So a company switchable
 * yesterday can silently vanish from this same dropdown today with no
 * schema change involved. Rather than the flat generic message for that

 * this company (via its stores) and name it specifically. Purely a
 * read-only query against the existing table — no schema change.
