// FedEx Ship API v1 — real shipment creation, built from FedEx's publicly
// documented Ship API (developer.fedex.com/api/en-us/catalog/ship.html),
// same OAuth2 client_credentials app as the existing Track API polling
// (see fedex-auth.ts's header comment on why the same env vars are
// reused). UNCONFIRMED against a real FedEx account — no sample
// request/response was provided for this round, unlike Shipglobal (whose
// client was built from the user's own pasted docs) or Aramex (whose
// tracking client was built from an uploaded WSDL kit). This mirrors the
// publicly documented request/response shape as closely as possible but
// has NOT been verified against FedEx's sandbox or production — see the
// project delivery notes for exactly what needs a real credentialed test
// before this is trusted with a real booking.
//
// DDP vs DDU: FedEx's own field for this is
// requestedShipment.customsClearanceDetail.dutiesPayment.paymentType,
// which takes 'SENDER' (importer of record pays = DDP-equivalent) or
// 'RECIPIENT' (buyer pays = DDU-equivalent) — NOT literally "DDP"/"DDU"
// strings. This client accepts the app's own 'DDP'/'DDU' enum (matching
// the other 4 new couriers, for one consistent UI) and translates it to
// FedEx's paymentType at the API-call boundary, so the mapping lives in
// exactly one place if it ever needs correcting against a real account.
//
// BOOKED AMOUNT: FedEx's Ship API response includes
// completedShipmentDetail.shipmentRating.shipmentRateDetails[] with a
// totalNetCharge per rate type (ACCOUNT/LIST/etc) WHEN the requester has
// rating enabled on their account — this is the one courier of the 5 new
// ones most likely to return a real quoted price at booking time (Delhivery
// typically does not — see delhivery-ship.ts). Falls back to a null
// amount (caller falls back to a rate-card estimate) if the response has
// no rating block, rather than guessing at a value.

  // header comment on FEDEX_API_BASE for why). The real response shape
  // differs from what was originally guessed in two ways:
  //
  // 1. LABEL: the label document does NOT live at
  //    completedShipmentDetail.shipmentDocuments[] — that field is simply
  //    absent from a real response. It's one level down, per package, at
  //    transactionShipments[].pieceResponses[].packageDocuments[], each
  //    entry shaped { url, docType, contentType }. This — not the
  //    labelResponseOptions setting above — was the actual reason no label
  //    ever came back: the code was reading a field that doesn't exist.
  //    contentType "LABEL" picks out the shipping label specifically,
  //    since an international shipment's packageDocuments can also carry
  //    other document types (e.g. a commercial invoice) in the same array.
  //
  // 2. RATE: shipmentRateDetails[].totalNetCharge is a plain number
  //    (e.g. 157.56), not a { amount, currency } object — currency is a
  //    sibling field on the same rate-detail entry. Reading
  //    totalNetCharge.amount/.currency (the original code) silently
  //    returned undefined for both on every real response, so bookedAmt
  //    and bookedCurrency were always null even when FedEx quoted a real
  //    rate.
